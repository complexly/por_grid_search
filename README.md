This repo includes python code associated with the paper "Evaluating the principle of relatedness: Estimation, drivers and implications for policy" (accepted in Research Policy, preprints at https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02942v2) by Yang Li and Frank Neffke.

According to the data use agreement, the raw data in the research couldn't be shared. However, the code could be adapted for similar data structure, like patent or scientific publications.
