# README

This repo includes python code associated with the paper "Evaluating the principle of relatedness: Estimation, drivers and implications for policy" (accepted in Research Policy, preprints at https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02942v2) by Yang Li and Frank Neffke.

Data use agreements prevent the authors from sharing the raw data used in this research. However, matrices that contain relatedness estimates between industries (SIC as well as NAICS) at the establishment, firm, city and country level based on the paper's preferred specifications are listed in the relatedness_matrices folder.


The specific code regarding the loading and processing of raw data are also not included in this repo. However, the rest of the code could be adapted for similar data structure, like patent or scientific publications.
